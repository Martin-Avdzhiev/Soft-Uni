    // The source has a starting yield, which indicates how much spice can be mined on the first day. 
    // After it has been mined for a day, the yield drops by 10, meaning on the second day it’ll produce 10 less spice than on the first, 
    //on the third day 10 less than on the second, and so on (see examples). A source is considered profitable only while its yield is at least 100 – 
    //when less than 100 spices are expected in a day, abandon the source.

    // The mining crew consumes 26 spices every day at the end of their shift and an additional 26 after the mine has been exhausted. 
    //Note that the workers cannot consume more spice than there is in storage.
